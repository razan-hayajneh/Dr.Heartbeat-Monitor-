# Dr.Heartbeat-Monitor-
In this project, created an application that a patient's heartbeat has been monitored by his doctor through Dr. Heartbeat Monitor app, which will get BPM data from Dr. Heartbeat Monitor drive through Bluetooth and saved in a database to enable his doctor to monitor the medical condition. The device consists of an Arduino connected to a pulse sensor to take BPM (number of pulses per minute), displays this data on the patient's LCD screen, and sends this data via the Hc-417 Bluetooth module to the app and then save to the database. Therefore, the doctor can monitor his patient's heartbeat from any place through the internet by Dr. Heartbeat Monitor application, which will make this program classified as IOT (Internet of Thing) category.
