Our project is a device that has been programmed by the Arduino programming
language. It measures the users’ heartbeat average each 1minute and sends it via
Bluetooth Hc-417 module to an application that was programmed by Android
language. This application receives the heartbeat and calculates the average
heartbeat per minute (BPM) and stores it in a firebase (online database) using
application.
Users must login into our Dr. Monitor application in order to be able to receive the
BPM data and present it as Eco-Diagram. After that, the application will calculate
the average BPM and save it in the user’s database.
Users can preview or edit their personal information through their profile.
Users can see their current BPM and BPM records in BPM monitor page.
